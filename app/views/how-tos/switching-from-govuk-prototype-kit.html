    <p>
      If you have learned how to use the
      <a href="https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/"
        >GOV.UK Prototype Kit</a
      >, you will be able to use the NHS prototype kit. This is because the
      two prototype kits are built in the same way. However, you must do some
      things differently.

      Installing and running the NHS prototype kit
    </h2>

    version of Node.js – you may need to install and use a different version. If

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Using routing and session data</h2>
    <p>
      When you save any changes to <code class="language-markup">routes.js</code>
      file, the app will restart. This will also delete all session data and reset them with any values set in <code class="language-markup">data/session-data-defaults.js</code>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Publishing your prototype online</h2>

    <p>
      Set the password using the variable
      <code class="app-code">PROTOTYPE_PASSWORD</code>. Check the
      <a href="/how-tos/publish-your-prototype-online"
        >guide to publish your prototype online</a

      for more details.
    </p>

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Updating your prototype </h2>

    <p>If you want to update your prototype to the latest version, you will need to download the latest version of the kit and copy some files into your prototype. Go to the <a href="/how-tos/updating-the-kit">guide on updating the kit</a> for more details.</p>
