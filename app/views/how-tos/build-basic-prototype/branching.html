<p>
  Our 1st question asks the user if they have had symptoms of magical powers
  in the last 30 days. We're going to send them to an "ineligible" page if
  answer anything other than yes. Sending users to different pages based on
  their input is called branching.
</p>
<p>
  To do this, we're going to need an
  <code class="language-markup">{{exampleIneligible.url}}.html</code> page, and
  some logic to decide when to send users there.
</p>
<p>
  This kind of logic goes in a file called
  <code class="language-markup">app/routes.js</code>, which is written in
  JavaScript. Routes tell the kit what to do when the user goes to specific
  pages.
</p>
<p>
  The route takes the answer the user gave to the 1st question and either
  sends them to the next question or the ineligible page, depending on their
  answer.

<ol class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--number">
  <li>
    <p>
      Make an
      <code class="language-markup">{{exampleIneligible.url}}.html</code> page
      by copying <code class="language-markup">content.html</code> from
      <code class="language-markup">docs/views/templates</code> to
      <code class="language-markup">app/views</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Update the content to tell the user why they're ineligible and what they
      can do next.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  To check it works,
  <a href="http://localhost:3000/{{exampleIneligible.url}}"
    >go to http://localhost:3000/{{exampleIneligible.url}}</a
  >.
</p>
<h2 id="create-a-route">Create a route</h2>
<p>
  We're going to write some logic to process the user's answer to question 1. If
  the user has had magical symptoms in the last 30 days, we'll send them to
  question 2. If they answer with anything else, we'll send them to the
  ineligible page.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, the <code class="language-markup">{{exampleRadios.url}}</code> page
  sends the user directly to question 2. Instead, we're going to send them to a
  special URL where we can run some code to check their answer.
</p>
<ol class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--number">
  <li>
    <p>
      In <code class="language-markup">{{exampleRadios.url}}.html</code> change
      the form action to
      <code class="language-markup">/{{exampleRadios.url}}-answer</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open <code class="language-markup">/app/routes.js</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Insert new JavaScript into line 5, before
      <code class="language-markup">module.exports = router</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<pre
  tabindex="0"
><code class="language-markup" >// Run this code when a form is submitted to '{{exampleRadios.url}}-answer'
router.post('/{{exampleRadios.url}}-answer', function (req, res) {

// Make a variable and give it the value from '{{exampleRadios.legend}}'
var magicPowers = req.session.data['{{exampleRadios.legend}}']

// Check whether the variable matches a condition
if (magicPowers == "yes"){
// Send user to next page
res.redirect('/{{exampleTextArea.url}}')
} else {
// Send user to ineligible page
res.redirect('/{{exampleIneligible.url}}')
}

})
</code></pre>
<ol start="4"class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--number">
  <li>
    Check it works. Selecting "Yes" should send you to the next question. Any
    other answer should send you to the ineligible page.

</ol>
<h2 id="if-it-does-not-work">If it does not work</h2>
<p>
  If you do not get a page, check in the terminal to see if the kit has crashed.
  This is a common problem if there's a typo in the JavaScript. If so, the kit
  will try to tell you the line number with the issue.
</p>
<p>If the kit crashes, you will see something like this on the terminal:</p>
<pre
  tabindex="0"
><code class="language-markup" >/Users/name/projects/{{exampleServiceURL}}-prototype/app/routes.js:12
});

  The 1st line of this sample output ends with

<p>
  The "12" suggests there's probably an issue on line 12 or the line before it.
  In this case, the issue was a missing bracket.
