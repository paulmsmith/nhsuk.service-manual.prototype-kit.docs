<p>
This tutorial shows you how to prototype a fictional "{{exampleServiceName}}" service that will:
</p>
<ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
  <li>ask 2 questions</li>
  <li>show the user's answers for them to check</li>
  <li>show a confirmation page</li>
</ul>
<p>
It will take about an hour to finish this tutorial, after you install the prototype kit.
</p>

<p>
Our prototype will look a bit like this:

<p>Our prototype will look a bit like this:</p>

<figure class="nhsuk-figure">
  <img class="nhsuk-figure__image" src="/images/tutorial-overview.png" alt="The first page has the title 'Start page' with the button 'Start now'. This is linked to a 2nd page with the title 'Question 1' and a 'Continue' button. This forks to 2 different pages. 1 is titled 'Ineligible'. 2 is titled Question 2. Question 2 is linked to a page titled 'Check answers'. This links to page 6, titled 'Complete'.">

<h2>Before you start</h2>

<p>
  Before you start, you must <a href="/install/simple">install</a> and run the
  NHS prototype kit.
</p>

<p>
  You'll also need a code editor. Any HTML text editor will do, but we recommend
  <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> (also known as
  VS Code). This is because it is free and has lots of
  useful features.
