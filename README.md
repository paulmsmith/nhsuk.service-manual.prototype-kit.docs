# NHS.UK prototype kit documentation

This repository contains the content and code for the guidance website for the NHS.UK prototype kit.

For the code for the NHS prototype kit itself, see [nhsuk-prototype-kit on GitHub](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-prototype-kit).

## Running the website

Start the code by running `npm run watch`.

## Contribute

If you want to contribute to the NHS.UK prototype kit guidance, then read our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Style guide

We normally use the [NHS content guide](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content) for terms. But there are some terms that are only used in the guidance for the kit:

### command line

Lower case. Only use for Windows instructions. Normally it will be ‘the command line’.


#### GOV.UK Prototype Kit, GOV.UK Design System and other GOV.UK products

Title case.

#### NHS, NHS.UK, NHS England

Use ‘NHS.UK’ for products that are for delivery teams and not the public (find out more on the [NHS health writing A-Z](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/a-to-z-of-nhs-health-writing#N))This includes the NHS.UK prototype kit, NHS.UK design system, NHS.UK service manual or NHS.UK website.

#### NHS England laptops

Use ‘NHS England Windows laptops’ instructions for people using corporate laptops.

#### NHS.UK prototype kit

‘NHS.UK’ is in caps and ‘prototype kit’ in lower case (except where the NHS.UK is shown as a logo when it is then presented as ‘NHS Prototype kit’). Write out in full the first time it is used on a page, then call ’the kit’. Do not use ‘prototype kit’ if you can.

#### terminal

Lower case. Only use for Mac and Linux instructions. Usually it will be ‘the terminal’.
